        <h3>What does the committee do?</h3>
        <p>
          Whilst Bubwith Tennis Club may be on the grounds of Bubwith Leisure &
          Sports Centre (and indeed they own the land on which the club stands
          on), the club is an independent organisation with no direct connection
          with BLSC, apart from being their tenants, or any other organisation
          or company. The club is run by a committee of volunteers, made up of a
          variety of people who give their time and services for free. This
          group, voted in at the Annual Member’s Meeting (usually in February),
          keeps the club running on a day-to-day basis, whilst looking towards
          the future and how the club can develop.
        </p>
        <h3>How to get involved</h3>
        <p>
          The committee is always looking for new people to get involved. Fresh
          ideas and different skills will always be required. Never been on a
          committee before? No problem. That’s not important. To begin with, the
          most important qualities are to care about the club and to be happy to
          put your point of view across. The club is entirely dependent on
          members to run it so please give thought to the possibility of
          becoming involved, even if in a small way. To find our more how you
          can get involved, us the form on the contact us page or speak with one
          of the current committee members.
