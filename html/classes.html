    <div><h3>What equipment is needed to play tennis?</h3></div>

    <div>
      <p>
        Tennis requires really only a few pieces of equipment to get started.
        You can shop online or buy second-hand if you are just starting out.
      </p>

      <h2>Wait…Do I have to join a fancy club to start playing tennis?</h2>
    </div>

    <div>
      <p>
        No! I have been playing tennis for many years and joining a tennis club
        is not necessary! Most places have free tennis courts that you can play
        on outdoors. If you are looking to play indoors then you may need to
        find a gym or a club with indoor courts.

    <div><h3>Tennis Racket</h3></div>

    <div>
      <p>
        Getting a tennis racket is one of the first things you will want to do.
        If you are a tennis newbie then you may want to borrow one from a friend
        before making a purchase. Tennis rackets range in price from around $15
        to well over $100. If you buy a racket that is pre-strung it won’t cost
        you much. Some premium rackets will cost you more and you will have to
        get them strung. You will want to find one that works for you and your
        budget. If you are just starting off….one like this would work just
        fine! Start out by making sure the weight of the racket is not too
        heavy. Get a feel for how the grip feels in your hand.
      </p>

    <div><h3>Tennis Balls</h3></div>

    <div>
      <p>
        There are a few different brands of tennis balls to choose from. You can
        start off with purchasing a can or balls (like this) or a bag (like
        this) depending on how much you plan on playing. You will need to switch
        out balls once they start to go flat.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div><h3>Tennis Shoes</h3></div>

    <div>
      <p>
        Having a good pair of athletic shoes is important to keep your body safe
        and strong. Trust me… you do not want to experience shin splints. Visit
        your local shoe store for court shoes that will protect your feet
        especially if you will be playing outside on a concrete court. Can you
        play tennis in running shoes? You can…and if you are just trying out
        that may be a good option. If you plan on playing tennis on a regular
        basis…I would get yourself a pair of court shoes
      </p>
    </div>

    <div><h3>Comfortable Clothing</h3></div>

    <div>
      <p>
        You will want to pick out clothing that is comfortable and you can move
        well in. Having pockets in your shorts, skirt, or pants is preferable so
        that you have somewhere to stick extra balls.
      </p>

    <div><h3>How Do You Play Tennis? The Basic Rules of Tennis</h3></div>

    <div>
      <p>
        The goal of tennis is to hit a ball back and forth across the net until
        you can score a point. In order to score a point your opponent is going
        to have to either miss the ball, hit it out of bounds, or hit it in the
        net. One of the best things to remember when you are wanting to win a
        point is to let your opponent make the mistake. Sometimes we try to get
        fancy and put a spin on a shot or hit it really hard and that is not the
        way to win. Be patient and just focus on hitting the ball on the tennis
        court and over the net!
      </p>
    </div>

    <div><h3>How to Start a Tennis Game</h3></div>

    <div>
      <p>
        Whether you are playing doubles or singles they both start usually with
        a racket spin. There are generally two ways of doing this. You can
        either put your tennis racket head on the ground and let it spin until
        it drops or you can spin it in your hand away from your opponent and let
        them say “stop” (this method is easier on your racket.) This is to
        decide what side of the court each player is on as well as who gets to
        serve first. It is very similar to a coin toss. If you look on the end
        of the handle to your racket you will see some sort of symbol. It will
        depend on what brand you have as to what you see. If you have a Wilson
        racket you will want to have the spin be either “M” or “W”. If you have
        a Prince racket it will be a “D” or “P”….you get the idea! Whoever wins
        the spin gets to pick whether they would like to choose the side that
        they start on or if they would like to serve first.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div><h3>I won the flip….What should I pick?</h3></div>

    <div>
      <p>
        This is going to vary from one person to the next but I always choose to
        serve first. Why? Your tennis serve is YOUR way of controlling the
        point, the game, and the match! If you are not happy with your
        serve…then maybe pick the side until you feel more confident. If the sun
        is in your eyes and you forgot your shades. Pick the side.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div><h3>The Sequence of a Tennis Game</h3></div>

    <div>
      <p>
        Once the server is decided they start the game by starting at the
        baseline to serve the ball from the right side of the court. When
        serving they are aiming across the court diagonally to the service box
        on the other side of the net. If the serve is “in” then that point is
        played out until the ball goes out of bounds, in the net, or bounces
        twice. If the server misses the serve, they get a second chance to
        serve. If the second serve is missed the point is over and the receiver
        wins the point. To start the next point the server walks to the left
        hand of the court to serve the next point and the receiver switches
        sides as well. Once the game is over…the serve goes to the opponent and
        they serve the entire next game.

    <div><h3>Tennis Scoring…Don’t let it scare you!</h3></div>

    <div>
      <p>
        One of the most frightening parts of learning how to play tennis is the
        scoring. Have you ever watched a tennis match and had no clue what the
        players are talking about? Does it seem like they are just yelling out
        random numbers? It may seem a bit random at first…but you will get the
        hang of it. Here is a quick outline of the basics.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div><h4>Point…Game…Set…Match!</h4></div>

    <div>
      <p>
        You play each “point”. Points add up to a game. Games add up to a set.
        Winning sets… lead up to winning the match! Points go like this: Zero:
        Love First point won: 15 Second point won: 30 Third Point won: 40 Fourth
        Point: Game All: This means you have a tied score. Expect when you have
        a deuce. Example: 30 All Deuce: When the score is 40-40 Ad in: Server
        needs one more point to win. Ad out: Receiver needs one more point to
        win. In order to win a game you have to be 2 points up. You must win at
        least 6 games and be ahead by 2 in order to claim a set. Once you have
        won 2 sets…then you have won the match. Still, confused? Read our
        complete guide on tennis scoring

    <div><h4>How to Serve the Ball</h4></div>

    <div>
      <p>
        Learning to serve is one of the most important skills you will gain as a
        tennis player. Here are some basic tips for serving. You will stand with
        your feet behind the baseline and toss the tennis ball into the air. As
        the ball travels back down, you make contact with it pushing it over the
        net and diagonally into the service box where your opponent is. There is
        no one way to serve a tennis ball…and there is no formula to follow that
        will get you the perfect serve. Some people toss high others toss low.
        Some people hop…others keep their feet planted. You will want to spend a
        lot of time practicing this crucial stroke.
