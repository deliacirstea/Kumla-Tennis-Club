          The sophisticated player requires a place where their game and their
          friendships can grow together. Kumla Tennis Club provides an
          incredible atmosphere to meet your neighbors and enjoy a divine day on
          the courts. The Club offers options to join competitive teams and
          intra-club matches. Additionally, extensive tennis clinics and
          professional instruction are available weekly. With a history of more
          then 30 years in the business and list of long list customers we dare
          to say that we might be the best in Sweden.

          More than just a scenic place... Tennis and Pickleball give our
          members another way to be inspired and grow on the courts. Our six
          fully lighted courts have been artfully crafted to include amenities
          most would expect only at a resort. The patio is a great place to meet
          up with friends before your match. Coffee and refreshments are
          available each morning, as well as refreshing towels, outdoor heat
          lamps and sunblock- all within steps of the courts. Built with the
          sophisticated neighborhood player in mind, the facility inspires
          members to play at the top of their game.

          Lifelong Friendships It's more than just a game. For our members,
          tennis and pickleball make up an entire community of friends of all
          ages and skill levels who enjoy friendly court banter and a great
          match! Getting together in an untraditional setting also brings forth
          a strong bond of community. Monthly dinner gatherings, round robins,
          volunteer opportunities and fun club events like our annual Tennis
          Sneaks and Cleats Tournament allow for members to connect with each
          other in a completely different way than your standard match.
